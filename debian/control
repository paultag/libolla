Description: hack to avoid typing out full domains
 By overrideing `getaddrinfo`, we can use shorthand domains, such
 as `d.o`, or `d.n` to talk about `debian.org` or `debian.net`
 domains.
 .
 This means such stuff as:
 .
   git clone git.d.o:/git/collab-maint/dputng.git
 .
 will work without any sort of trouble at all.
 .
 Since we're all lazy. You know.
